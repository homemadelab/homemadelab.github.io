This is the official repository of the board game Coronavirus made by HomemadeLab Games.

## Usage

The game is supposed to be played on a smartphone or a tablet using a web browser.

After scanning the QR code on the physical game board, you will be greeted with a screen that asks which language you want to play in. Then, select the category that you or your friends are currently playing in the game. A random question will load and a timer for 60 seconds will start. You will have the question that was previously randomly selected and the 3 possible answers that are randomly sorted as well. Once you select a question, it will either light up green or red indicating the validity of your answer (green for correct and red for incorrect). An icon will appear on the bottom of the page. When pressed, it will load a page with the source of the answer to the question highlighted. If the time runs out and you did not choose any answer, the screen will turn red and the correct answer will show up in green. You can load the page to get a new randomly selected question or you can go back to choose another category.
